# welcome to my website

Here I have the source code for my website. It is using hugo to automatically create everything needed for the website to run.

If there is anyone out there who maybe has something good to share, then they can come and make a request to add their content to the site. After reviewing it I will add it to the add the site and even give credits to the author.

All you need to do is send me a markdown document and I will format it the way it needs to be. Just make a pull request.
