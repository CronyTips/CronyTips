In this post I will explain my reason's for using and loving linux.

# 1. It's free

[GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html) is a free operating linux. If I wan't to install linux on my machine I don't need to spend 100$ on a `license` just to do a installation or do a clean install. This is also one of the reasons that I distro hopped for about 2 years until I settled down on [manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) for about 1 year.

# 2. It's open-source

GNU/Linux is open source which means that if you wan't you can look at the code to check if somebody is spying on you. Yea I'm looking at you `Microsoft`. You can also if you have experience in programming try and help in development of the Linux [kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) or `software`.

# 3. Security

Now to connect to my last point GNU/Linux is much more [secure than windows](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3252823/why-linux-is-better-than-windows-or-macos-for-security.html) because updates are comming faster and the code is always changing. It is also because GNU/Linux doesn't have that much usage still but that will probably change soon, maybe even sooner that we see.

# 4. Package managers

In GNU/Linux it's much easier to find and install software than `windows`. In windows you need to go to web, then search for software and then find the real link to download the software without the virus. Good luck with that.

While in GNU/Linux you open your terminal and give it the command to install the software. Ofcourse for those that don't know or wan't to use the terminal there is always GUI software stores like gnome store or pamac.

# 5. Software

There is much more software and it is in most cases more minimal and only have features that you need. In windows you have software that have so many features than you might only use 20% of them, while in linux you can have software only with what you need.

Also if you have experience in programming you can fork the program, then add or remove features that you need and maybe release the software.

# 6. Ease of use

In my opinion GNU/Linux is much more easir to use than `windows`. At the very least that is my opinion and to tell those that maybe think that it is because I didn't use windows a lot because I used it for more than 10 years.

# 7. Customization

You can customize your GNU/Linux desktop to be exactly what you wan't. Like that you can also boost your productivity and ease of use even more. Like what I did whit my setup and ended up with a [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) setup that I heavily customized. Here you can see a look at my setup.

All in all my opinion of GNU/Linux will probably never change because it is just what I need of a desktop OS. But still everyone has their opinion and that is hard to change.
