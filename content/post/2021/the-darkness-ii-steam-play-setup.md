I'm sure that some of you have tried playing The Darkness II with Proton but found yourself not being able to run the game. If you were to go to ProtonDB you would see that everyone was saying that you need crack for the game to work which is true because Steam DRM integrated into the game doesn't work with Proton.

So here I will walk you trought the steps to get The Darkness II working with Proton.

1. Go to this [link](https://megagames.com/fixes/darkness-2-limited-edition-v10-all-no-dvd-prophet?noradio=1) and download the crack.
2. After you finished downloading remove the d form the extension and extract the zip archive.
3. Go inside the folder and extract another zip archive.
4. After that open another file manager window and go to this path. `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Darkness II`
5. Copy the contents of the folder with the crack into the game folder and overwrite the files.
6. Go inside steam and start playing and enjoying the game.
