In this post I will be talking about the best mail client for linux in my opinion.

> hope Mailspring devs don't mind

In search of a mail client that could support all my email accounts (I have 4 or 5 of them) I stumbled upon Mailspring, a free email client that in the end ended up being my mail client of choice.

### Features that I love and use
- multiple accounts (support almost every email available)
- unified inbox that shows every email from every account
- dark mode
- linux support

The only downside for Mailspring is that you need to make a Mailspring account, but if you ask me it is worth it completely. From my usage I haven't experienced any bugs or issues.

I hope that you guys like my recommendation and that you will give me yours also.
