> nice pic ( don't wanna angry the immortal king )

It's the year 4386 of the Cultivation Calendar. Everyone cultivates and science is very used alongside it. But one day the demon king Tuntian-ha ( a giant freaking frog ) comes into their world. The Cultivation Tactic Unit comes to fight the frog. But with all that happening our mc Wang Ling 6 years old at the time was buying himself some fast food ( Totally didn't forgot the name, Immortal king don't get angry please >-< ). While TCTU was fighting with the Demon King, one member Zhuo Yi started to get chased by the Demon King. While being chased he saw our mc being under the path that the Demon King was going to fall down to. Zhuo Yi saved him but our mc dropped his food, after which Zhuo Yi told him to go home and started fighting with the Demon King again. But he was defeated fast, and moments before killed, Wang Ling comes below the Demon King and kicked him from below and defeated it. 10 year later Wang Ling starts to go ho High school, and Zhuo Yi became the Honorary Cultivator of the Hundred Academy Union.

Ok that was a lot of text, but that is literally about first 10 minutes of the first episode out of 15 of them. First, this is a Chinese anime so it will also have Chinese voices, so if you only want cute Japanese anime girls who always scream ONI-CHAN! then this anime isn't for you. This is a comedy anime, or that would make you believe. In the later episodes it becomes more and more serious. It also has romance, romance so hard that our mc would even create an alternate universe to save his fated one (Didn't happen in the anime). The last 2 episodes are the most nerve wracking and the most interesting ones.

All in all this is a great anime really worth watching, and it is also getting a second season. So I really recommend you to watch this anime.

I hope everyone will have great time watching it, also write in the comments some anime you recommend for me to watch.
