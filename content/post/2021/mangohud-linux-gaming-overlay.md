All the gamers that are trying out Linux are always asking for msi afterburner overlay alternative for linux. Well there is one which in my opinion is even better than msi afterburner called [MangoHud](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud). MangoHud is an open source vulkan and opengl overlay that monitors your fps, temperatures, CPU/GPU load, power usage and more. Also has benchmark support.

MangoHud also has support for nvidia optimus laptops which really helps someone like me to be able to correctly see my gpu usage while playing opengl games which is great. MangoHud is also uses very little resources which means no big performance hit while playing games.

[flightlesmango](https://github.com/flightlessmango) the creator of MangoHud also created a website where you can upload your benchmarks and compare them with other people. Here is the [FlightlessMango](https://flightlessmango.com/)
