If you are a fan of old school arena shooters like unreal tournament then you will love Xonotic. Xonotic is a great shooter game that has great gameplay that is really easy to understand but hard to master. The point of xonotic is speed and using a correct weapon in right situation which can help you a lot.

Xonotic also has **GOOD** graphics that look really good and make most graphics card cry while trying to run the game at stable fps. Multiplayer is also pretty good and you will find people to play against in any time of the day which will help you get rid of boredom.

I recommend any linux user to install this game because it is a good game to play when you are bored and want to pass some time and rage quit in the end because you have been killed 50 times and no kills, **SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE**.

From my experience this game is available in literally every distro repo.
