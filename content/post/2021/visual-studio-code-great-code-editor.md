> my c# example

We all know that it is very hard to find a code editor, especially for linux because most of the popular IDE's support Windows only. That is why Microsoft comes into rescue with their open source code editor Visual Studio Code. It is a electron based code editor that is very expendable. 

### Some of its main features are:

##Extensions

Vscode supports a wide variety of programming languages with the help of its extensions. You can make your vscode work for c,c#,c++,java,js,rust,go... and because of Microsoft is the creator it has great support for c# on linux.

## Themes

Vscode also supports themes to make it dark or  bright, blue, green and a lot more. It can also help you with syntax highlighting so that you can have easier time programming.

Pros:

- open source
- expendable
- themes
- great community

Cons:

- telemetry
- heavy (electron)

All in all it is a great code editor that I recommend to you. Comment down below some of your favorite code editors.
