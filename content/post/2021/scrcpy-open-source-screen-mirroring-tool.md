There are a lot of android screen mirroring tools existing, but most of them are either really bad or a paid product that really don't have any good features. That is where scrcpy (stands for screen copy) comes into play.

Some of it features are:
- lightness (it is a light program that only shows the device screen)
- performance (it can easily do 30 or 60 fps)
- quality (has very good image quality)
- low latency
- fast startup
- non-intrusiveness (nothing is installed on the android device)
- keyboard and mouse input support

To be able to use this tool you need to have an with phone with at least android 5.0, you also need to have adb debugging enabled.

{{< notice warning >}}
For some phones you need to enable additional settings on your device to be able to use mouse and keyboard. Here is the link to the [github issue](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/70#issuecomment-373286323)

For installing the tool I will give you the link to their [github page](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/#get-the-app) on that subject. It supports windows, linux and mac os.

Scrcpy also supports screen recording so that you can easily record your android phone screen without any performance loss.

For more on this amazing tool I recommend to read their [github page](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/).

I hope that everyone likes this tool. Write in the comments about any more tools that I can try out.
