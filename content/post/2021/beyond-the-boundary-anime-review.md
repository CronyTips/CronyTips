They should never have met. They shouldn't even exist. But when they come together, the entire world will change. The last surviving member of her clan, Mirai Kuriyama is cursed with the terrifying ability to control and manipulate blood, a power so heretical that she is shunned even by those with the ability to understand her "gift". Akihito Kanbara is only half human, but while the monstrous other half of his lineage seems to have doomed him to a life alone, it has also given him near invulnerability in the form of rapid healing. Alone, their futures seem bleak, but when a chance encounter brings them together, it becomes clear that they share more than just an unexpected bond. Together they share a destiny and a mission that only the two of them together may be strong enough to survive.

At the first look this anime looks very cute, characters are cute and even the monsters are cute. There is quite a cast of characters here, from perverts to clumsy girls, and yes there is a girl who screams ONI-CHAN don't worry. Story has pretty good progress and is full of mystery's. I would recommend this anime to everyone who isn't scared of monster and cute things. But don't let that fool you because this anime gets pretty serious in the later episodes and gets quite heavy on the hearth. All in all in my opinion this anime is a must watch.
