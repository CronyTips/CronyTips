We all know that **MS Office** is the mainstream office suit which is used by a majority of people. That is also one of the reasons for a lot of people to not consider **linux** as their main operating system. But a lot of people also doesn't know that there are free replacements for MS office. Most of the linux users use the replacement called [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), and I cant say that it is a bad piece of software but for my needs it is **bloated**, yes bloated because it has so many different options and also so many different office components Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Base, Math, and Charts. And that is a problem for me because I only need a word processor, presentation editor and spreadsheet processor with only the basic editing because thinks like math I will rather do in Latex and make documents with markdown and the use pandoc to compile them to pdf rather that use word. Now then lets see what does OnlyOffice have.

# Look and feel

In therms of look and feel it is pretty similar to newer versions of MS Office and that makes it easier for long time MS Office users to get used to the software. It is also very modern looking. It also has a home screen which opens up when you launch the program.

# It's open-source

OnlyOffice is completely open-source. You can see the whole code on their [GitHub](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/) account. Which means that people that limit them self to only use open-source software wont have anything to say about that.

# Cloud integration

You can integrate OnlyOffice into a cloud service for example NextCloud without losing any of its features like for example MS Office online which loses a lot of functionality that the desktop version has.

# Compatibility

OnlyOffice in my testing was 100% compatible with MS Office files. Sometimes I work with a couple of word and excel documents a day and I never had any problem opening, editing and saving any of the files. Even making new word document never gave me any compatibility issues with MS Office or any other Office. I also never had problems with presentations either actually in overall OnlyOffice works for me better than any other MS Office version (Except 2010).

All in all OnlyOffice is an amazing office suite with amazing MS Office compatibility that never let me down. I hope that you will give OnlyOffice a try.

Write in the comments if you know about any other good ms office alternative.
