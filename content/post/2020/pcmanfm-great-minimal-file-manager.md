We all know that a file manager is a essential part of user experience especially if you have an underpowered pc or laptop that doesn't isn't able to search 1000 files easily. Where that is PCManFM comes because it is made exactly with that in mind. PCManFM uses very small amount of ram and it is also very fast and responsive with great looks.

PCManFM is very customizable which means that you can make it into something like what I showed in the screenshot or you can make it into something else. It is also supports any possible terminal emulator which means that you can use even those unknown ones. You can also use something called modules to add more functionality. I don't have any experience with them first hand.

PCManFM supports gtk theming and also system icons which means that you can transform its looks into anything you wish.

Installing PCManFM is very easy since it is in most default repos for any package manager.

Arch

`sudo pacman -S pcmanfm`

Debian/Ubuntu

`sudo apt-get install pcmanfm`

Fedora

`sudo dnf install pcmanfm`

Solus

`sudo eopkg install pcmanfm`

I hope that this post helped you in search of a minimal and lightweight file manager.
