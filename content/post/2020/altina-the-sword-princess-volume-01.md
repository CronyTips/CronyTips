I was bored and I started reading Altina the sword princess. I really like it but there is one thing I had the whole time while reading it, can you guess what?. It was deja-vu, why you ask yourself? Because I read the manga about half a year ago. And I found it much better than the manga. Now lets talk what is good about it and is it worth to reccomend it to you guys!

# What do I like about it?

I love the characters! They feel so realistic and relatable that I almost felt like I was there while reading the novel. We have an mc that got sended to the end of a country in the middle of a war because of other people's screw up. He can't even read the books that he love's so much because they are so damn expensive. But he is also depressed because if his commander listened to him they might would be able to escape that.

Then we have the girl, a princess with red hair and quite younger than the mc. She believes in him and want him to help her as an a tactician. The interaction beetween them is good and pretty funny.

The other cast of characters is also very good and relatable with good interaction.

# What I dont like?

For my taste it is a little bit too slow paced. But that is all

All in all I reccomend you to read the Novel and I hope that you can give me some reccomendations. Also tell me what can I do to make my posts better to read and more engaging for you guys in the comments.
