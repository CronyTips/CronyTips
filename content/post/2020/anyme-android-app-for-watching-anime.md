In this post I will be writing about an android app called Anyme.

Anyme is an android app for watching anime from a lot of different sources while also being completely free. I have been using Anyme for almost 2 yeas and never thought of using any other app or program on my phone. Now if you are asking yourself why am I not using something like [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) or [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/) its because a lot of anime isn't available for my country so I have to stream them and Anyme really helps me watch any anime I want. So why do I love Anyme so much, well here are a couple of reasons.

### Completely free

Anyme is completely free with no ads whatsoever. It also removes ads from the sites it uses which means you will have ad free anime watching experience even on most ad bloated sites without them. It also doest us any permissions which means that it is completely safe.

### MyAnimeList integration

Anyme is first app ever that integrated with MyAnimeList ever. That also means you can follow your progress on your pc or any device that has a browser and Internet connection. When you get a new device you wont need to have backups or be scared of loosing all your progress because it is all on the Internet.

### Great ui

Anyme has great ui which you will learn how to use in a couple of minutes and will always want something similar to it. It also has a great search system which is very easy to use but at the same time very advanced.

### Helps you find anime

Anyme has a lot of menus which show you what anime is popular right now, what is watched, seasonal, discord recommendations and big variety of genres (categories). It also has recommendations based on what you watched but for this you need to make a Kanon account. There is also a continue menu which opens up menu where you can continue any anime that you might have had missed a season or ova.

### Random anime

Anyme also has a random button that will chose an anime from your plan to watch list. This option helped me because I have almost all the time about 100-150 anime in my plan to watch list.

### Stats

Anyme also has your stats which show your favorite studio, what genre you watch the most. It also has How many episodes you have watched (by the time of making this I watched 5433 episodes), how many days have you "wasted" ( 89.9 by the time of this post ) and also a weeb level( my level is 196, which puts me under Anime God ). For this you also need to make a Kanon account.

### Anime info

Anyme has a lot of info about every anime which also includes their song which helped me a lot when I'm downloading my anime song playlist for traveling. What character where in the show, their voice actors and much more.

### A lot of sources

Anyme doesn't host anime it self but uses a lot of different site to stream anime from them with no ads and also being able to download them for offline watching which is pretty neat. 

# Installation

Now after I said why I love Anyme so much next is how to install and usage like what account you will need to make. You need to go to [Anyme](https://zunjae.github.io/anymeapp.com/) and download apk. After downloading install it. After installation when you open Anyme you will need to either sign up or sing in into an MyAnimeList account. If it is your first time hearing about MyAnimeList click sing up and create an account. After you sing in you will be brought into the app. Just one reminder you will have ti sign in every week because of MyAnimeList. Optionally you can go to stats and make a Kanon for more functionality like the ones that I said already about in this blog.

You can also use a different video player for watching. I personally use MX player which is great for android phones. I also recommend that you first check everything about the app like setting and everything else.

I hope how this was very helpful for most of you. I will be very happy if you where to use or at least try using Anyme for all your anime needs because it is more than you will ever need for an anime watching app especially on android.

You can also comment about what program or website you are using for watching anime.
