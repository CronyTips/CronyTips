In this post I will write about a open-source manga reader named Tachiyomi.

<!--more-->

---

After closing of MangaRock I'm sure a lot of manga readers had a hard time searching for a different manga reader. That is why I'm going to introduce you an open-source alternative that is much better than MangaRock named [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/). Why do I say that Tachiyomi is better than MangaRock, well let me name a couple of reasons.

- Completely free

Tachiyomi is completely free to use and without any ads. That means you can have a great reading experience without any ads interupting while reading like in MangaRock.

- Open souce

Tachiyomi is also open source which means that you can go and look at the code and see how it work and maybe even contribute if you have programming experience.

- Great ui

Tachiyomi looks great and is easy to get used to. It also has better reader than what you had in MangaRock and you can also set custom color options to make your manga be slithly green or something like, even lowering the brightness for midnight reading.

- A big amount of sources

What I mean by this is that Tachiyomi uses a lot of websites for searching and reading manga. It's sources are made like separate app that community mostly made which means most of most popular manga sites are almost ceartainly free.

- Unlimited donwload

You can download manga as long you have disk space on your phone. I can say that this is completely true because I always have about 5-6 GB donwloaded manga to read for when I'm offline.

Now if I have convinced you let me show you how to use install and use Tachiyomi because it is diferrent than most app that you probably have ever used. I will show you the process of installation and usage with short video clips so that you can if you wan't skip the text if you don't wanna read.

# Installation

{{< vimeo 436390311 >}}


For installation you will need to go to the `Tachiyomi` website and click on the download link. Allow your browser to download the apk fille. After you have finished downloading open the file. If you phone ask's you for permission to install app from `unknown sources` you need to enable that option. Then click install and wait for it to finish. When installation is finished you have installed Tachiyomi.

# Basic usage

### Installing source extensions

{{< vimeo 436399925 >}}

Sources in Tachiyomi are called extension and you install them like apps because if tachiyomi had all sources in itself you would get updates almost daily and it would be a big download. So back on topic to install source extensions you need to open Tachiyomi app, then click on the browse in the lower menu. Then change to extenstions menu with scrolling right to left or clicking on the extensions text. Then you have to chose what extension to install. In this example I use MangaLife. All you need to do is scroll down until you find MangaLife or any other extenstion and click on the install button. Installation is the same as tachiyomi app which means if it ask's you for installataion from `unknown source` enable it, come back and click install button again, then click install again and that is it. It will automatically go back into Tachiyomi app so don't think that something is wrong.

### Best extensions

Now I will tell you what are the best extensions that I use.

First extension is `Madara` that I use for [Kissmanga.in](https://kissmanga.in/) (for a lot of unknown manga) and [Tonilly](https://toonily.com/) (a lot of different kind of webtoons).

Second extension is `MangaBox` which I use for [Mangaktalot](https://mangakakalot.com/) (One of biggest manga archives). 

Third extension is [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/) (high quility scans and fast chapter updates) which is my go to source. 

Fourth extension is [Webtoons](https://www.webtoons.com/en/) for some of the webtoons but I prefer Tonnily for over them.

Fifth extension is [MangaLife](https://manga4life.com/) because of it's high quilty scans and ocassional official english translations.

Sixth extensio is `MangaSee` because if I can't find manga on any other one MangaSee always has the manga that I wan't.

### Hidding unnedded sources

{{< vimeo 436408083 >}}

After installing extensions that I recommended you will have a lot of sources that you don't need. To disable them you need to go into sources and click at the icon in the top right (the one with 3 lines). The you just remove the blue tick from the uneeded sources. I left enabled: `Kissmanga.in`, `MangaDex`, `MangaLife`, `Mangakakalot`, `Mangasee`, `Toonily` and `Webtoons.com`.

### Adding and removing manga to library

{{< vimeo 436417240 >}}

To add a manga you need to go into Browse then you go to source of your choice or search for manga by clicking and the search icon. Either way once you find a manga you want to add to your library, you need to click on the manga. There you will see the description and chapters of manga. To add a manga you need to click the heart icon with  text `add to favorites`. Now when you go to your library screen you will see your manga. To remove manga once again click on it and then click on the heart icon. If you wan't to remove multiple manga at once you to be in your library screen, then you click on the manga and hold until it show another overlay. Choose other manga that you need to remove and then click the trash bin icon and then you can also choose to delete downloaded chapters.

### enable MangaDex search

To be able to search MangaDex you need to do a quick workaround which is: go to any manga from MangaDex, then click on the globe icon next to share icon. After that it will open MangaDex in webview where you need to Sing Up for their account. After that you will be able to use MangaDex search.

### Downloading manga

To download a manga you need to choose any manga from your library view. Then you need to go to chapter where all chapters are listed and waiting for you to read them. After that click on the three dots icon in the uper right corner and click `Download` where you will choose how many chapters will you download.

### Recommended settings to change

Now I will list a cople of options that I think you need to change for the best experience for you.

1. Theme

To have better enjoyment you can choose between light and dark theme, to do that you need to go here: `More` > `Settings` > `General` > `App theme`

2. Library update frequency

To get new chapters you yourself can set how often the library will update itself. To set your setting you need to got to: `More` > `Settings` > `Library` > `Library update frequency`

3. Reader setting

In tachiyomi you can customize your manga reader a lot and to do that go to: `More` > `Settings` > `Reader`

4. Download settings

You can also change your download settings a lot give it a thought. For them go to: `More` > `Settings` > `Downloads`

5. Advanced

It is also a good idead to go to advanced settings at least every mont to clean cache and cookies. For that go to: `More` > `Settings` > `Advanced`

# Tracking

In tachiyomi you can have third party tools track your progress and I personaly use AniList because It is a pretty good thing to have. You don't need to do AniList because Tachiyomi also supports MyAnimeList, Kitsu, Shikimori and Banguni. Every one of them has different setting up so I won't be doing that here.

# Backup's

You can also enable backup's in Tachiyomi and I personally have them enabled to every week to create one. You can also choose where to save them so that is isn't easy to lose them.

After all this I hope that you have some understanding of Tachiyomi and that you will have great experience using it. Please tell me in comments if you found this blog helpfull or if you need any help I will gladly help you with all I have knowledge of.
