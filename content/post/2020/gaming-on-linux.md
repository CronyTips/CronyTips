In this post I will be talking about my experience on the topic of gaming on GNU/Linux and its state in this day and age.

Old Linux veterans must remember the old days when you either wasn't able to play the games that you wanted to play or you had to spend big amount time trying to make the game run at stable performance. But that is not the case anymore, `Gaming on Linux` is becoming the future day by day and I'm not lying. I haven't been a Linux for long time, actually I became a Linux almost 4 years ago. Still I saw a huge improvement in Gaming on Linux.

From the gists that I know before tools like [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/), [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) and Steam's [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) entered the stage you had to spend time manually configuring your games in wine hoping that you will succeed in making the game playable. I remember when I came to linux that Lutris still wasn't a mature as now and there weren't a big amount of steam titles running linux natively and because I have a budget I stirred away from even trying running wine games and only played that small amount of native steam games and a lot of open-source games.

Then about 1 or 2 years later Steam Play was announced and I saw Doom gameplay with Vulkan. I immediately tried to play my games but found it still laking. But I didn't want to give up so I tried installing some games with Lutris and they worked either with 5-15% lower performance or 5% better performance than on Windows 10. Yes  had better performance even though I had a budget laptop.

Then again some time after Lutris managed to get Epic Games Launcher to run on Linux where I had at that time almost over 100 games that I got from giveaways. But there was one problem, my integrated graphics card didn't have Vulkan support or so I thought but a couple months after I found out that my Radeon R2 gpu had experimental support on Linux for Vulkan and I spent a couple of days trying to enable it on my Manjaro installation when I found out that I only had to install `amdgpu-experimental` and then restart my system and that was it I had Vulkan support up and running.

# Conclusion

After everything that happen now days I'm able to run every game that I was able to run on Windows either with a small performance hit or with better performance. All I can say that even in after a time frame of only 4 years gaming on Linux has become so much better that I never think coming back to Windows because of games. Well I do almost only play singleplayer games so that is also one of the reasons that I never run into problems with gaming, but what can I do about it when I don't have any friends except for Linux. And still I mostly spend time either watching anime, manga or light novels like a true weeb

Well then I hope that this blog was somewhat informative for all of you and that maybe you will hesitate a little less about coming to Linux because of games.

You can also write in the comments what you think of the state of linux gaming.
