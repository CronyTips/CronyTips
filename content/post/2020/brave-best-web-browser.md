In this post I will be talking about my favorite web browser Brave.

<!--more-->

What browser do you use? Google Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi ,Opera or maybe something else. I searched for a good web browser for a couple of years and after all that I found the one that is right for me. And that is [Brave](https://brave.com/). Now for the reasons that I love it.

## Open Source

Brave is completely open source and based on Chromium browser which also means that you will still be able to use your favorite Google Chrome extensions so you have no need to be scared of that.

## Privacy

Brave is a privacy oriented browser with a system called Brave Shields which comes with built in ad-blocker, cross-site trackers blocker, https connection upgrader, scripts blocker, multiple cookies settings and multiple fingerprinting settings. Which saved me of more than 40,500 ads and trackers, almost 1GB of bandwidth and 34 minutes of loading time.

## Cross platform

Brave is available to download for all major platform like Windows, Apple ecosystem, Linux and Android. I personally use brave on all my devices and I have never been happier with a browser.

## Brave rewards

Brave has a system called Brave Rewards which makes it so that you can give rewards to the websites and content creators who deserve it. You can also get crypto currencies while browsing the web with Brave which makes it also a source of income.
