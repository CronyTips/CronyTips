In this post I will be talking about a open source epub reader.

A epub reader is very useful programs especially if you are like me and read light novels or other kind of e-books that mostly come in the .epub format which can be a problem to read without a good epub reader. That is when I came upon a program called Foliate which is able to open epub books without any problems. It is on the slower side ( my laptop is very low end so that might be the case for me only ) but it is still a great piece of software that comes with a lot of useful options and functionality.

- It has a built in library which shows recently opened e-books.
- You can change reading font, spacing, margins and width.
- It supports custom themes which allows for those Unixporn users to have a good book look
- Supports four layout's ( Automatic, Single Column, Scrolled and Continuous )
- Can automatically hide cursor
- Support for realistic shadows ( looks like a real book )
- And a lot more options

> this is how my foliate looks like

As you can see from the screenshot above foliate looks very minimal and distraction free when reading which helps you read your books with only text in front of you.

From my experience with foliate you shouldn't have problems with opening even some of the drm locked e-books, but I only tried some of them. Image support is great so you wont have problem of having blank space instead of images like in some reader ( I'm think about you Zathura ).

All in all Foliate is a great epub reader worth using and support. If you want to have a better look ate the Foliate checkout their [website](https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/)

# Installation

Foliate is in both flatpak and snap format, but it is also in the most distros repository's so it should be easy to install with your distros package manager.

Write in the comments about your preffered method for reading epub books.
