How to I find light novels that I want to read? Actually it is quite easy because all Light Novels are those that either had Anime or Manga adaption, maybe even both. Now you are maybe asking yourself "Why are you only reading them?". Well that is because it means their story captivated me enough to want to know what happened beyond Anime or Manga adaption. And there are a lot of them, I have about 100 Light Novels downloaded ready to be read. And while I'm reading them I will probably for those that I start reading that I will from the start review every volume so that I will maybe hook some more of you guys on.

So now to do I find and download Light Novels. Well I have 2 main sources, one source has official Translations for those big Novels that have been licensed and second one for web novels that don't have official translations or aren't that known. Now I will name the two sources.

1. [That Novel Corner](https://thatnovelcorner.com/)

For official translation That Novel Corner is the best source. Every month he takes requests for what Light Novels to first get the official translations. He has a big amount of Light Novels and I really love his work and that is also one of the reasons why I don't have ad blocker on when I download form his site. He accepts donations but since right now and for a couple of yeas in the future I wont have a source of income I wont be able to donate anything, but I still encourage you to if you like his work that you give him donations because the guy deserves the.

2. [VN Meido](http://www.vn-meido.com/k1/index.php?topic=3084.0)

This more like a community than a website where otakus like Me and a lot of other gather. I will link to thread where it list all Light Novels there and I can tell you that there is a huge number of them. Here you will almost always gonna find fan translations of popular but also unknown Light Novels. That is also the reason why I use this community and that is mostly because I love fun translations of unknown Light Novels, just love them. So yeah if you want to only fun translation no strings attached just vn meido for your Light Novels needs because you will be more than satisfied and one more thing is that in the forum Index I linked there are linked all Light Novels on the forum and there are so many of them that the thought of trying to count them never crossed my mind.

Now after everything is said and done I wish you good reading and have fun immersing in some Light Novels that maybe your haven't even heard of.
