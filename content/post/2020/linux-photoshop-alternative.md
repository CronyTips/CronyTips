We all love and know Adobe suit programs, from which most people probably know photoshop. But linux users aren't so lucky to have Adobe suit available on linux and that is why I will be talking about 2 photoshop alternatives.

#1. GIMP

GIMP or Gnu Image Manipulation Software is the most popular photoshop alternative on any platform not just linux. GIMP is available on Windows, Linux and MAC OS which makes is crossplatform. Its most noticeable downside is its user interface which is very confusing. That is also one of the reasons that there is a GIMP fork with better looks (similar to photoshop) named [PhotoGimp](https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP).

All in all GIMP is and amazing photoshop alternative available on all distros, snap, flatpak and appimages.

#2. Krita

Krita is another great photoshop alternative available on linux. Krita is more focused on drawing that image manipulation but it can do both with no problem. Krita has user interface much more similar to photoshop than GIMP but it still less popular than GIMP for image manipulation.

Also a great photoshop alternative available on all distros, snap, flatpak and appimages.
