Youngest son of a wealthy family lived a very blessed life. After losing his mother and crippling his right hand his Father sent him away while saying that they don't need a burden. After he came to countryside he decided to die alone.

At least that is what was supposed to happen. After a week of coming to countryside and not eating or drinking anything came a young girl that was bought by his father to become his wife.She was like a springtime in his life teaching him of happiness.

And that is a small synopsis of the manga. This manga left a pretty big impression on me because main character (Tamahiko Shima) was a huge pessimist that hated and dint trust everyone. But after the young girl (Yuzuki Tachibana) came into his life he begins to learn what is happiness.

But don't let it get the better of you because there aren't' only happy moments, after all there was a time where the girl almost died and where the boy almost killed himself for her but I leave it to you that you read it yourself because it is very interesting.

Story is very deep and also good it kept me wanting to read more that I read the whole manga In half the day after all it only has 42 chapters. The ending was predictable but also it was in one hand unpredictable because it dint end exactly the way that I predicted. But the ending is the best one that could be for this great manga.

All in all I give the manga 9/10 score because I wish that it was a bit longer but what can I do.

Also tell me in the comments if you know of any manga that is similar to this, I would love to read them.
